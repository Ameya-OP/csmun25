        <h3>Letter from the Secretary-General</h3>
        <p>
          Dear Delegates,<br><br>


          Dear Delegates,

          It is with immense pride and excitement that I welcome you to the Cornerstone Model United Nations 2025.

          CSMUN has always stood as more than just a conference — it is a platform for ambitious minds to challenge
          convention, engage in critical diplomacy, and grow into the leaders our world urgently needs. As
          Secretary-General, I am honoured to steward this year’s edition, promising a meticulously curated experience
          where debate is spirited, ideas are bold, and collaboration is at the heart of every committee.
          <br>
          <br>
          Whether you're a seasoned delegate or stepping into committee for the first time, CSMUN 2025 is your stage to
          speak, to lead, and to be heard. We’ve worked tirelessly to ensure this conference is not only intellectually
          rigorous but also deeply memorable — a celebration of diplomacy, discourse, and diversity.
          <br>
          <br>
          I cannot wait to witness the passion and perspective each of you will bring to the table. Here's to two days
          of diplomacy, dialogue, and discovery.
          <br>
          <br>
          Warm Regards<br>
          <strong>Ameya Joshi</strong><br>
          Secretary-General, CSMUN 2025
