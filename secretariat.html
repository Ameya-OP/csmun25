          s the Secretary-General of CSMUN 3.0, it is my distinct honour to welcome you to this landmark edition of our conference. Over the years, my journey through Model United Nations—as a delegate, chair, and now organiser—has been shaped by the belief that meaningful dialogue can drive real-world change. I am a passionate student of diplomacy, debate, and design, and I bring to this role not only my experience in MUNs, but also a deep commitment to creating spaces where diverse perspectives are heard and respected. CSMUN 3.0 reflects that vision. This conference has been carefully curated to balance intellectual challenge with inclusivity, offering each participant the opportunity to think critically, speak confidently, and lead empathetically.

Behind the scenes, CSMUN 3.0 is the result of tireless planning, countless hours of collaboration, and an unshakable belief in the power of student-led initiatives. Our secretariat is a vibrant team of thinkers, creators, and problem-solvers who have worked with dedication to bring this conference to life. Outside of MUNs, my interests in programming, chess, and design have taught me the importance of strategy, creativity, and attention to detail—principles that have shaped the way we’ve built this year’s edition. Whether you’re returning to committee or experiencing your first conference, I encourage you to immerse yourself fully. Ask bold questions, build meaningful connections, and remember that your voice holds weight. On behalf of the entire Secretariat, I warmly welcome you to CSMUN 3.0—and I look forward to witnessing the impact you create.

        <p class="role">Director General</p>
        <p class="desc">It is a distinct honour to serve as the inaugural Director General of Interschool Cornerstone
        School MUN. I still remember walking into my first MUN session with hesitation—unsure of the
        procedures, uncertain of my own voice, and reluctant to even raise my placard. But somewhere
        in the midst of debate and late-night research, I discovered a space where diplomacy felt real
        and ideas sparked meaningful dialogue. With five conferences behind me, each has shaped my
        growth as a leader and deepened my belief in the power of youth-driven change.
        As I step into this role, my vision for CSMUN is rooted in three guiding values: authenticity,
        curiosity, and courage. I envision a conference where delegates don’t simply participate—they
        connect deeply, question critically, and lead boldly. Together with an exceptional Secretary
        General and a dedicated secretariat, we are committed to creating an experience that is not
        only intellectually enriching, but truly transformative.This first edition of Interschool CSMUN isn’t
        just the start of something official—it’s the start of something exciting. A space where bold
        ideas, sharp comebacks, and real conversations come together. We’re here to debate, to learn,
        to lead—and maybe even have a little fun along the way. Let’s make it count.</p>

        <p class="desc">As Director General of the first edition of Cornerstone’s Interschool Model United Nations, I
        believe I’ve stepped into a role that embodies leadership, responsibility and maybe some
        mild chaos management - and I wouldn’t ask for it any other way. I’ve always admired the
        remarkability of how MUNs manage to combine the gravity of global challenges along with
        the warmth of human connections. Which is why I am now exhilerated to channel my
        experience as a delegate and my organisational skills into promoting critical thinking and
        global dialogue.
        My objective is to foster a space where diverse perspectives are welcomed and every
        delegate is empowered to go beyond their horizons and gain inspiration to shape the world
        beyond committee walls. With the support of an incredible secretariat and a shared vision of
        excellence, I am keen on making this MUN one filled with spirited debate, meaningful
        insights and memorable moments.</p>
